# Kickstarter-Outcomes
##Kickstarter Theater/Play Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Goals
### The purpose of this project is to help determine when and how much the goal should be for starting a kickstarter fund  
## Analyze the kickstarter campaigns for the following criteria
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date-
1. The data shows that the most successful theater campaigns were launched in the month of May	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals-
1. The data shows that the most successful theater campaings had goals of less than $1000 coming in at 76% sucessfull. 
2. Followed by campaings that were between $1,000 and $4,999 which were 73% successful. 
3. However, it also appears that campaigns between $35,000 and $44,999 were 67% successful.  
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The summer months have the best outcomes
2. The winter months have the worst outcomes
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. I conclude that the most successful goals were the goals with the smallest amount.   
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. It would be nice to have the genre of the theaters/plays
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Other possible tables and graphs would be to show outcome based on the length of the campaign
